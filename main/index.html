            One of the most challenging aspects of change is learning to let go of the past. Whether it's leaving a job, ending a relationship, or simply evolving as a person, the process of shedding our old skin is both liberating and unnerving. In my latest blog post, I share my experiences with bidding farewell to the familiar and stepping into uncharted territory.</p>

I'll be sharing some of the reflection exercises that have helped me stay connected to my authentic self throughout this transformative period.</p>
